## Hi there 👋

Hi! I'm Kristofferson — a data and systems professional with a unique blend of analytics, enterprise IT, and ISO management systems experience. I bridge the worlds of data, process optimization, and technology governance, helping organizations turn complexity into clarity and insight.
With a background spanning IT banking, SAP S/4HANA, data analytics, and 18 years of ISO consulting and auditing, I’ve developed a systems-thinking approach that connects data, processes, and people. I love transforming raw information into meaningful insights, improving operational efficiency, and designing solutions that actually work for end users.
My professional interests include:
- Analytics strategy and deployment
- Data modeling, ETL, and SQL troubleshooting
- KPI design and insights generation
- Dashboarding and visualization
- SAP analytics and enterprise process optimization
- Data governance, risk-based controls, and ISO 27001/9001 integration
